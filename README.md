# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Double click on a call to archive or unarchive it. At the time I created this assignment, API calls were failing.

I have used React JS and SCSS ot create this application. Some of the icons I have used from Material UI icons.

I could have followed some best practices, due to time constrainsts I have ignored some.

I would have created a proper theme, Also colors could have been defined at a single place as a variable.
Also to remove duplication of css we can use mixins.
If we are creating this application on scale we can use React Context to avoid prop drilling.
API calls and other business logic we can extract out in a custom react hook.
